# Audit Report: mygoog_gui Initializers

## Purpose
- `MANIFEST.md`: Provides a high-level architectural overview of the GUI.
- `__init__.py`: Package marker and docstring for the GUI layer.

## Findings
- **Integration:** Standard Qt-based package structure. Manifest clearly delineates responsibilities between main window, workers, and styles.
- **Documentation:** The package docstring in `__init__.py` correctly identifies the purpose as providing a native desktop experience.

## Quality Checklist
- [x] Clear architectural manifest
- [x] Standard package initialization
