# Audit Report: mygooglib/core/utils/a1.py

## Purpose
- Bidirectional conversion between Google Sheets A1 notation (e.g., "Sheet1!A1:C10") and 1-indexed row/column coordinates. Essential for programmatic Sheets manipulation.

## Main Exports
- `col_to_a1(col)` / `a1_to_col(letters)`: Core conversion logic.
- `a1_to_range(a1_range)` / `range_to_a1(...)`: High-level range parsing and building.

## Findings
- **Sheets Limits:** Correctly handles and validates the 18278 column limit (ZZZ).
- **Quoting Logic:** Properly handles sheet names containing spaces or single quotes (using `''` escaping), which is a common source of bugs in Sheets integration.
- **Robustness:** Uses regex for range splitting, ensuring that complex sheet names don't break the cell parsing logic.

## TODOs
- [ ] [Feature] Support for unbounded ranges (e.g., "A:B", "5:10") if future workflows require operating on entire rows or columns.

## Quality Checklist
- [x] Docstrings follow project style
- [x] Type hints are complete and modern
- [x] Unused code removed
- [x] Logically verified for edge cases
