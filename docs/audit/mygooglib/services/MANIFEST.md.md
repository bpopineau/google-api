# Audit Report: mygooglib/services/MANIFEST.md

## Purpose
- High-level directory documentation explaining the roles and dependencies of service wrappers within `mygooglib/services`.

## Main Exports
- Documentation only: Lists `gmail.py`, `sheets.py`, `drive.py`, and `calendar.py` as key modules.

## Findings
- **Clarity:** Provides a concise and accurate description of the directory's purpose and its relationship with `mygooglib.core`.
- **Completeness:** Correctly identifies external and internal dependencies.

## TODOs
- [ ] [Technical Debt] Add references to new services like `appscript.py`, `contacts.py`, `docs.py`, and `tasks.py` which were likely added after this manifest was written.

## Quality Checklist
- [x] Docstrings follow project style (N/A for MD)
- [x] Type hints are complete and modern (N/A for MD)
- [x] Unused code removed
- [x] Logically verified for edge cases
