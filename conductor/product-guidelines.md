# Product Guidelines: MyGoog

## Communication & Tone
*   **Professional & Concise:** The application interface and notifications should be minimalist, efficient, and direct. Avoid unnecessary jargon or fluff; focus on helping the user complete tasks quickly.

## Design Philosophy
*   **Material Design:** Follow Material Design principles to create a modern, polished, and familiar user interface. This includes clean layouts, consistent use of components, and subtle, meaningful animations that enhance the user experience without being distracting.
*   **Information Density:** While following Material Design, prioritize a layout that allows for high information density, enabling power users to see and act on multiple data points simultaneously.

## User Experience (UX) Patterns
*   **Activity Monitoring:** Background automation status should be communicated via visual indicators (e.g., progress bars, status icons) within a dedicated "Activity" dashboard. This provides a central hub for monitoring all ongoing and completed tasks.
*   **Interactive Failover:** Automations should strive for autonomy but must pause and request user input if they encounter ambiguity, missing configuration, or recoverable errors. This ensures reliability and prevents unintended consequences.
*   **Integrated Learning:** Provide an integrated "Guide" page within the application. This section should host tutorials, workflow examples, and documentation for automation "recipes," making the "hackable" nature of the tool accessible and documented.

## Visual Identity
*   **Dark Mode Priority:** As a developer-centric tool, the interface should prioritize a high-quality dark mode that reduces eye strain and fits into a professional workspace.
*   **Status Colors:** Use a consistent color palette for status indicators (e.g., Green for success, Yellow for warning/pending input, Red for error).
