# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Theme:** Modern Dark Mode. High contrast, dark backgrounds, and subdued accent colors suitable for long sessions.
- **Aesthetic:** Clean, professional, and IDE-like.

## User Experience (UX) Philosophy
- **Functional Density:** Maximize information density without clutter. Show key data points (e.g., file sizes, dates, statuses) upfront.
- **Keyboard Centricity:** Full keyboard navigation support. Global hotkeys for rapid actions (e.g., quick add task, search).
- **Polished Feel:** While functional, the UI should feel "native" and responsive with immediate feedback for every action.
- **Efficiency:** Minimize clicks. Prefer single-click or keystroke actions for common tasks (e.g., archiving email).

## Interaction Patterns
- **Unified Search:** A central "Omnibar" for searching files, emails, events, and executing commands.
- **Split Views:** Support simultaneous viewing of different contexts (e.g., Task list alongside Calendar).
- **Console Feedback:** Provide clear, text-based logs or status updates for background automation tasks.
