# Implementation Plan: Re-establish AI Ergonomics Roadmap

This plan outlines the steps to audit the current codebase and formalize the AI Ergonomics Roadmap to improve AI agent performance and developer experience.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Framework Definition [checkpoint: f606a55]
- [x] Task: Initialize `conductor/ai_ergonomics.md` with core vision and philosophy. [126b55c]
- [x] Task: Define the "AI Friction" classification system (Context, Type, Structure, Logic). [126b55c]
- [x] Task: Establish the "Definition of AI-Done" for ergonomic improvements. [126b55c]
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Foundation' (Protocol in workflow.md) [f606a55]

## Phase 2: Comprehensive Codebase Audit
- [ ] Task: Audit `mygooglib/` for type hint coverage and documentation depth.
- [ ] Task: Audit `mygoog_cli/` and `mygoog_gui/` for structural consistency and logic duplication.
- [ ] Task: Audit existing "Context Maps" and directory `MANIFEST.md` files for accuracy.
- [ ] Task: Analyze "Context Window" footprint for common development tasks.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Audit' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Standards Formalization & Strategic Planning
- [ ] Task: Formalize the "AI-Friendly" standard in `conductor/code_styleguides/ai_standards.md`.
- [ ] Task: Identify and prioritize 5+ high-impact "Ergonomic Epics" based on audit findings.
- [ ] Task: Propose automated tooling (ruff rules, custom scripts) to enforce ergonomic standards.
- [ ] Task: Update `conductor/context_map.md` to reflect the current and desired future state.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Standards & Strategy' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4: Finalization & Handover
- [ ] Task: Final review of `conductor/ai_ergonomics.md` for clarity and actionability.
- [ ] Task: Integrate the roadmap into the main `conductor/backlog.md` where appropriate.
- [ ] Task: Create the first "Implementation Track" derived from the new roadmap.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 4: Finalization' (Protocol in workflow.md)
