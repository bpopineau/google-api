# Product Vision

## Target Audience
- **Primary User:** The developer (for personal use).
- **Persona:** A power user who wants a unified, hackable interface for their Google Workspace and values efficiency and automation over standard web UIs.

## Core Goals
1.  **Efficiency & Speed:** Perform common actions (email triage, calendar checks) faster than web browsers allow.
2.  **Unified Command Center:** A single desktop view (GUI) and CLI for Drive, Gmail, Tasks, and Sheets.
3.  **Automation Hub:** A platform for custom Python scripts to automate cross-service workflows.
4.  **Local-to-Cloud Intelligence:** Extract data from local files to create, update, or manage cloud resources (e.g., updating Sheets trackers from local logs).

## Key Features
-   **Desktop GUI:** Modern, dark-mode PySide6 interface for rapid interaction.
-   **Scripting Library (`mygooglib`):** Robust Python wrapper for easy API interactions.
-   **Data Pipelines:** Workflows to parse local data and sync/push results to Google Sheets or Drive.
-   **Instant Access:** Fast startup and background credential management.
