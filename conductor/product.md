# Initial Concept
It is most like A, but it's not meant to simply be an interface forever. I plan to create automated workflows between local files and google workspace. It's also to help create a unified interface for my work.

# Product Guide: MyGoog

## Vision
MyGoog is a unified desktop application and automation hub designed to bridge the gap between local work environments and Google Workspace. It evolves beyond a simple interface to become a powerful tool for personal productivity, enabling seamless workflows between local files and cloud services.

## Target Audience
*   **Primary:** Personal usage for workflow optimization and productivity.
*   **Secondary:** Developers and power users seeking a "hackable" and responsive alternative to browser-based tools.

## Core Value Proposition
*   **Unified Interface:** A single, fast desktop application to manage Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Tasks, and Sheets.
*   **Local-Cloud Bridging:** Seamlessly connect local data with Google Workspace (e.g., updating Sheets from local files).
*   **Cross-Service Automation:** Enable complex workflows that span multiple services (e.g., creating Calendar events directly from Gmail triaging).

## Key Features & Workflows
*   **Hybrid Automation:**
    *   **Background Processes:** "Set and forget" tasks that run on schedules or triggers (e.g., syncing folders, batch reporting).
    *   **On-Demand Actions:** One-click triggers within the GUI to execute complex, multi-step tasks.
*   **Data Extraction & Sync:** Tools to extract data from local sources and update Google Sheets or Drive automatically.
*   **Integrated Workspace:** A central dashboard to view and act on emails, files, and schedules simultaneously without context switching.

## Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance:** The application must launch instantly and remain highly responsive, even when background automation tasks are running.
*   **Extensibility:** The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing for the easy addition of new automation "recipes" and workflows as needs evolve.
